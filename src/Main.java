    /*
     Sorting
     what is sorting? you take a list of elements, and you sorted them ðŸŒš
     you will have the same elements but in different ordering
     we have two ways to order
     Ascending order, when List[i] <= List[i+1], or by other meaning when every element is less than or equal to the element next after it.
     Descending order, when List[i] >= List[i+1], or by other meaning when every element is greater than or equal to the element next after it.
     always remember to check that the number of elements didn't change.
     always what comes in mind when trying to sort is selection sort
     there is also other types like bubble sort and insertion sort.
     all these three time complexity is O(n^2) which is not the best thing
     there is others like merge sort and quick sort. which has time complexity of O(log n).

     //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
     Bubble Sort:
      how it works:
     simple we start by knowing if we want the order to be Asc or Desc
     we compare the element and the element next to it. (List[i] <= List[i+1])
     you need to know two things number of comparisons and number of swaps.
     number of comparisons = number of elements - 1 --> num of comparisons in all phases: (n(n-1))/2
     swaps depending on the numbers.
     you need to iterate till you get all the list sorted
     number of phases will be needed is N-1

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
     Selection Sort:
     **Selection Sort** is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It works by repeatedly selecting the smallest (or largest, depending on the sort order) element from the unsorted part of the array and swapping it with the first unsorted element. This process divides the array into two parts: the sorted part and the unsorted part, and gradually grows the sorted portion.

### Steps to Perform **Selection Sort**:

1. **Find the minimum (or maximum) element** from the unsorted portion of the array.
2. **Swap** the minimum element with the first unsorted element.
3. **Move the boundary** between the sorted and unsorted portions forward.
4. Repeat the process until the entire array is sorted.

### Step-by-Step Example:
Letâ€™s sort the following array in ascending order using Selection Sort:
```
Array: [64, 25, 12, 22, 11]
```

#### Step 1: First Pass
- **Unsorted portion**: `[64, 25, 12, 22, 11]`
- **Find the smallest element**: `11` (minimum in the unsorted portion).
- **Swap** it with the first element (index 0):
  ```
  [11, 25, 12, 22, 64]
  ```

#### Step 2: Second Pass
- **Unsorted portion**: `[25, 12, 22, 64]`
- **Find the smallest element**: `12` (minimum in the unsorted portion).
- **Swap** it with the first unsorted element (index 1):
  ```
  [11, 12, 25, 22, 64]
  ```

#### Step 3: Third Pass
- **Unsorted portion**: `[25, 22, 64]`
- **Find the smallest element**: `22` (minimum in the unsorted portion).
- **Swap** it with the first unsorted element (index 2):
  ```
  [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]
  ```

#### Step 4: Fourth Pass
- **Unsorted portion**: `[25, 64]`
- **Find the smallest element**: `25` (minimum in the unsorted portion).
- **Swap** it with itself (index 3):
  ```
  [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]
  ```

#### Step 5: Fifth Pass
- **Unsorted portion**: `[64]`
- No need to swap, as only one element remains.

### Final Sorted Array:
```
[11, 12, 22, 25, 64]
```

### Key Points:
- After each pass, the smallest unsorted element is moved to its correct position in the sorted portion.
- The algorithm always performs **(n - 1) passes** to fully sort an array of size **n**.

### Efficiency of Selection Sort:
- **Time Complexity**: The Selection Sort algorithm has a time complexity of **O(nÂ²)**, where **n** is the number of elements. This is because, in each of the **n - 1** passes, we have to scan through the unsorted portion of the array to find the minimum element.

  - For each element, it compares with every other element in the unsorted part.
  - For the first pass, it makes **n-1 comparisons**.
  - For the second pass, it makes **n-2 comparisons**, and so on.
  - Thus, the total number of comparisons is **(n - 1) + (n - 2) + ... + 1 = n(n - 1)/2 **, which results in **O(nÂ²)** time complexity.

- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity of Selection Sort is **O(1)** because it only uses a constant amount of extra memory for variables like indices and the temporary variable used during swapping.

### Advantages:
- Simple and easy to understand.
- It minimizes the number of swaps compared to algorithms like Bubble Sort.

### Disadvantages:
- Selection Sort is inefficient for large arrays because of its **O(nÂ²)** time complexity.
- It does not adapt to the input (e.g., even if the array is already sorted, it still performs the same number of comparisons).

### Visualization:

Consider this visualization of the array `[64, 25, 12, 22, 11]`:

1. **Initial Array**:
   ```
   [64, 25, 12, 22, 11]  // Select the minimum (11) and swap with the first element.
   ```

2. **After First Pass**:
   ```
   [11, 25, 12, 22, 64]  // Now, the first element is sorted.
   ```

3. **After Second Pass**:
   ```
   [11, 12, 25, 22, 64]  // Select the next smallest (12) and swap.
   ```

4. **After Third Pass**:
   ```
   [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]  // Select the next smallest (22) and swap.
   ```

5. **After Fourth Pass**:
   ```
   [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]  // Now the array is sorted!
   ```

That's how **Selection Sort** operates, focusing on finding the minimum element in each pass and moving it to its correct position!
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

    **Insertion Sort** is a simple, intuitive sorting algorithm that builds the sorted array one element at a time by comparing each element to those already sorted and inserting it into its correct position.

    ### How Insertion Sort Works:
            The algorithm divides the array into two parts:
            1. **Sorted portion**: Initially contains just the first element.
            2. **Unsorted portion**: Contains the remaining elements.

            The algorithm picks elements one by one from the unsorted portion and inserts them into their correct position in the sorted portion.

    ### Step-by-Step Explanation:

    #### Consider the array: `[5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6]`

            1. **Step 1**: Start with the second element, assuming the first element is already "sorted".
                    - Sorted portion: `[5]`
            - Unsorted portion: `[2, 9, 1, 5, 6]`

            2. **Step 2**: Take the first element from the unsorted portion (`2`) and compare it with the sorted portion (`5`).
                    - **Compare**: `2 < 5`
            - **Shift**: Move `5` to the right to make space for `2`.
            - **Insert**: Insert `2` in the correct position.
            - New array: `[2, 5, 9, 1, 5, 6]`
            - Sorted portion: `[2, 5]`
            - Unsorted portion: `[9, 1, 5, 6]`

            3. **Step 3**: Take the next element (`9`).
            - **Compare**: `9` is greater than `5`, so it stays in its position.
            - No shifts are needed.
                    - New array: `[2, 5, 9, 1, 5, 6]`
            - Sorted portion: `[2, 5, 9]`
            - Unsorted portion: `[1, 5, 6]`

            4. **Step 4**: Take the next element (`1`).
            - **Compare**: `1 < 9`, so shift `9` to the right.
                    - **Compare**: `1 < 5`, so shift `5` to the right.
                    - **Compare**: `1 < 2`, so shift `2` to the right.
                    - **Insert**: Insert `1` at the beginning.
                    - New array: `[1, 2, 5, 9, 5, 6]`
            - Sorted portion: `[1, 2, 5, 9]`
            - Unsorted portion: `[5, 6]`

            5. **Step 5**: Take the next element (`5`).
            - **Compare**: `5 < 9`, so shift `9` to the right.
                    - **Compare**: `5 = 5`, so no more shifting is needed.
            - **Insert**: Insert `5` in the correct position.
            - New array: `[1, 2, 5, 5, 9, 6]`
            - Sorted portion: `[1, 2, 5, 5, 9]`
            - Unsorted portion: `[6]`

            6. **Step 6**: Take the last element (`6`).
            - **Compare**: `6 < 9`, so shift `9` to the right.
                    - **Insert**: Insert `6` in the correct position.
            - Final array: `[1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 9]`
            - Sorted portion: `[1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 9]`

    ### How It Works Internally:

            - For each element in the unsorted portion, we scan the sorted portion from right to left to find the correct position.
                    - **Shifting** elements to the right creates space for inserting the element in its proper place.

    ### Complexity:
            - **Best case**: `O(n)` (the array is already sorted).
            - **Worst case**: `O(n^2)` (the array is sorted in reverse order).
            - **Average case**: `O(n^2)` (when the elements are in random order).

            Insertion Sort is efficient for small arrays or nearly sorted arrays, but less efficient for large, randomly ordered arrays due to the `O(n^2)` time complexity.

    ### Visualization of the Example:
            Initial array: `[5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6]`

    | Step | Array Status           | Sorted Portion      | Unsorted Portion    |
    |------|------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
    | 1    | `[5] [2, 9, 1, 5, 6]`  | `[5]`               | `[2, 9, 1, 5, 6]`   |
    | 2    | `[2, 5] [9, 1, 5, 6]`  | `[2, 5]`            | `[9, 1, 5, 6]`      |
    | 3    | `[2, 5, 9] [1, 5, 6]`  | `[2, 5, 9]`         | `[1, 5, 6]`         |
    | 4    | `[1, 2, 5, 9] [5, 6]`  | `[1, 2, 5, 9]`      | `[5, 6]`            |
    | 5    | `[1, 2, 5, 5, 9] [6]`  | `[1, 2, 5, 5, 9]`   | `[6]`               |
    | 6    | `[1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 9]`   | `[1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 9]`| `[]`                |

            The array becomes fully sorted after all steps.

    ### Conclusion:
            Insertion Sort is simple, but not very efficient for large datasets. It is particularly useful when you have small arrays or arrays that are mostly sorted.
            ** number of comparisons is not fixed, it depends on the elements in the list.
            ** the best one between these three is even though all of them are O(n^2): insertion, selection, bubble sort (in order).

    ///////////////////////////////// Stack and Queue ///////////////////////////////////////////////////
        // array and array list are linear DS,and and the access on them is direct through out the index.
        // now we'll talk about stack and queue, the access for them is sequential access.
        // Stack is LIFO(Last-In First-Out).
        // Queue
        // any application that is about reversing could be done using stack.
        // what are the operations on stack:
        // for adding elements: use push method
        // for accessing elements: use peak(which is the top elements in the stack and the only element that could be accessed).
        // for deleting elements from the stack: use pop method. note that pop method will return the deleted element from the stack.
        // so for example: stack.push(2), stack.push(3), int x= stack.pop(), the deleted value will be returned in the x which is 3.
        // stack has only "single point of access " as i mentioned before.
        // what will change the value of the stack(active methods) is push and pop, methods won't change the value of the stack peak(used only to access).
        // you can't pop an empty stack(EmptyStackException)


        /*
        ### **What is a Stack?**

A **stack** is a linear data structure that follows the **Last In, First Out (LIFO)** principle.
This means that the last element added to the stack will be the first one to be removed. A stack can be visualized as a vertical collection of elements where insertion and deletion happen at the **same end**,
 called the **top** of the stack.

### **Basic Operations on a Stack**:
1. **push(element)**: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
2. **pop()**: Removes and returns the top element of the stack. Throws an error if the stack is empty.
3. **peek() or top()**: Returns the top element without removing it.
4. **isEmpty()**: Returns `true` if the stack is empty, `false` otherwise.
5. **size()**: Returns the number of elements in the stack.

### **How a Stack Works**:

- **Push Operation**: When you push an element onto the stack, it is added to the top. The previous top element moves down, and the newly pushed element becomes the top.

  Example:
  ```
  Stack: [ ]
  push(5)
  Stack: [5]
  push(10)
  Stack: [5, 10]
  ```

- **Pop Operation**: When you pop an element from the stack, the top element is removed, and the next element in line becomes the new top.

  Example:
  ```
  Stack: [5, 10]
  pop() -> returns 10
  Stack: [5]
  ```

- **Peek Operation**: When you peek at the stack, you just check the top element without removing it.

  Example:
  ```
  Stack: [5, 10]
  peek() -> returns 10
  Stack: [5, 10]  // no change

### **Applications of Stack**:
Stacks are widely used due to their LIFO property. Here are some real-world and computer science applications:

1. **Function Call Management (Recursion)**: When a function is called, its local variables and return address are pushed onto the call stack. Once the function completes,
the call stack is popped to return control to the previous function.

   Example: A recursive function call structure.

2. **Expression Evaluation**: Stacks are used to evaluate expressions in postfix notation (also known as Reverse Polish Notation). They are also used in converting infix expressions to postfix or prefix.

   Example:
   - Infix: `(A + B) * (C - D)`
   - Postfix: `AB+CD-*`

3. **Undo/Redo Operations**: Most text editors or applications use stacks to implement the "undo" and "redo" features.

4. **Browser History**: Browsers use stacks to track history. When you press the back button, the last visited URL is popped from the stack.

5. **Balanced Parentheses and Syntax Checking**: Stacks are useful to check if a string of parentheses, brackets, or braces is balanced.

   Example: Checking if `((a + b) * (c + d))` has properly matched parentheses.

6. **Depth-First Search (DFS) in Graphs and Trees**: DFS is implemented using stacks, either explicitly in code or implicitly via recursion.

7. **Stack-Based Algorithms**: Several algorithms, such as those for finding the nearest smaller element, use stacks for efficient computation.

### **Common Questions on Stacks**:

1. **Evaluate a postfix expression**: Given a postfix expression like `52+83-*`, evaluate the result using a stack.

2. **Check if parentheses are balanced**: Write a program that checks if the parentheses in a given string are balanced.

   Example:
   - Input: `({[]})`
   - Output: `true`

3. **Implement a stack using two queues**: Implement a stack data structure using two queues and ensure it operates with push and pop.

4. **Find the next greater element**: Given an array, for each element, find the next greater element (on the right). If there is no greater element, return `-1`.

   Example:
   - Input: `[4, 5, 2, 25]`
   - Output: `[5, 25, 25, -1]`

5. **Reverse a stack**: Given a stack, reverse the elements using recursion or another stack.

6. **Implement two stacks in an array**: Implement two stacks in a single array to maximize space utilization.

### **How It Works**:
1. **push()**: Adds an element to the end of the list (which represents the top of the stack).
2. **pop()**: Removes and returns the last element in the list (the top element).
3. **peek()**: Returns the last element without removing it.
4. **isEmpty()**: Checks if the stack is empty by checking if the list is empty.
5. **size()**: Returns the number of elements in the stack.

### **Advanced Stack Questions**:
1. **Implement a Min Stack**: Create a stack that, in addition to `push` and `pop`, also provides a `getMin()` method that returns the minimum element in constant time.

2. **Sort a Stack**: Write a function that takes a stack and sorts it in ascending order using only stacks (you may use additional stacks or recursion).

3. **Reverse a Linked List using Stack**: Given a singly linked list, reverse it using a stack.

---

### **Stack Time Complexity**:
- **Push**: O(1) (constant time) because you only add an element to the top.
- **Pop**: O(1) because you remove the top element.
- **Peek**: O(1) because you are just checking the top element.

### **Conclusion**:
A stack is a fundamental data structure that has a wide range of applications, from parsing expressions to managing function calls.
Its simple LIFO property makes it easy to implement but powerful in solving various algorithmic problems.
 Mastering stack operations and their applications is essential for solving many common data structure and algorithm questions.

    // Stack Applications: Delimiter Matching
        /*
        how that works:
        **Delimiter Matching** is a common application of stacks, used to check whether opening and closing delimiters (like parentheses, brackets, braces)
        are correctly matched in a string or expression. This ensures that symbols like `()`, `{}`, and `[]` are used in the correct order.

### Step-by-Step Explanation of Delimiter Matching

#### Problem:
We are given a string that contains delimiters (parentheses, braces, and brackets) mixed with other characters. We need to ensure that:
- Every opening delimiter (like `(`, `{`, `[`) has a corresponding and correctly placed closing delimiter (like `)`, `}`, `]`).
- The delimiters are correctly nested (e.g., `({[]})` is valid, but `([)]` is invalid).

#### Example:
Consider the string:
`"{[()]}"`
This string is correctly matched, while
`"{[(])}"` is not.

### Approach Using a Stack

1. **Initialize an Empty Stack:**
     - We will use a stack to keep track of the opening delimiters.

2. **Iterate Through Each Character of the String:**
     - If the character is an **opening delimiter** (`(`, `{`, `[`), push it onto the stack.
     - If the character is a **closing delimiter** (`)`, `}`, `]`), check if it matches the **top** of the stack:
     - If the top of the stack has the corresponding opening delimiter, pop the stack (i.e., remove the matched opening delimiter).
     - If the stack is empty or the top of the stack does not match the closing delimiter, the string is **not balanced**.

3. **At the End of the String:**
   - If the stack is **empty**, it means all delimiters were matched correctly.
   - If the stack still contains any opening delimiters, the string is **not balanced**.

### Step-by-Step Example

Let's take an example string:
`"{[()]}"`
- Initialize an empty stack: `[]`.

#### Iteration 1: `{`
- Encounter `{`, which is an opening delimiter.
- Push it onto the stack:
  Stack: `[{]`

#### Iteration 2: `[`
- Encounter `[`, another opening delimiter.
- Push it onto the stack:
  Stack: `[{, []`

#### Iteration 3: `(`
- Encounter `(`, another opening delimiter.
- Push it onto the stack:
  Stack: `[{, [, (]`

#### Iteration 4: `)`
- Encounter `)`, which is a closing delimiter.
- Check the top of the stack (which is `(`), and it matches the closing `)`.
- Pop the stack:
  Stack: `[{, []`

#### Iteration 5: `]`
- Encounter `]`, which is a closing delimiter.
- Check the top of the stack (which is `[`), and it matches the closing `]`.
- Pop the stack:
  Stack: `[{]`

#### Iteration 6: `}`
- Encounter `}`, which is a closing delimiter.
- Check the top of the stack (which is `{`), and it matches the closing `}`.
- Pop the stack:
  Stack: `[]`

At the end, the stack is empty, meaning all delimiters were matched correctly.

### Incorrect Example: `"{[(])}"`

Let's take an incorrect string:
`"{[(])}"`

#### Iteration 1: `{`
- Push `{` onto the stack:
  Stack: `[{]`

#### Iteration 2: `[`
- Push `[` onto the stack:
  Stack: `[{, []`

#### Iteration 3: `(`
- Push `(` onto the stack:
  Stack: `[{, [, (]`

#### Iteration 4: `]`
- Encounter `]`, a closing delimiter.
- Check the top of the stack (which is `(`), and it **does not match** the closing `]`.
- **Mismatch detected**: The string is **not balanced**.

        // MatchingDelimiter method example:
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
//        System.out.println("enter expression: ");
//        String expression = scanner.nextLine();
//        System.out.println("is it matched? "+ MatchingDelimiter.isBalanced(expression));

        // second Stack Application is infix to postfix conversion

        // infix (x + y) when the operator is between the expressions
        // postfix xy+ when the operator is after the expressions
        // prefix +xy when the operator is before the expressions
        // how to works:
        // we have operands and operators
        // if we have a operand we send it to the output instantly
        // if we have a operator we push it to the stack, in condition that the stack is empty or the operator in the stack has lower priority.
        // if i have a opening delimiter push it to the stack, and if i have closing delimiter pop the elements in the stack till we get to the opening delimiter.
        // example: 5 + 6
        // stack: +(pushed to the stack and popped in the end)
        // output: 5 6 + (final result)


        ///////////// Queue(FIFO) First-in-First-Out///////////////////
/*
A **queue** is a linear data structure that follows the **FIFO** (First In, First Out) principle. This means that the first element inserted into the queue is the first one to be removed.
The operations typically supported by a queue are **insertion (enqueue)** at the rear and **deletion (dequeue)** from the front.

### **1. How the Queue Works:**
the queue we have is a **circular queue** implemented using an array. In this design:

- **`front`** points to the first element of the queue (the element that will be removed next).
- **`rear`** points to the last element inserted into the queue.
- When inserting an element, it is added at the rear.
- When removing an element, it is removed from the front.
- When the rear reaches the end of the array, it "wraps around" to the beginning using the modulo operation (`%`), making it a **circular queue**.

### **2. Types of Access in a Queue:**
- **Enqueue (Insert):** Adds an element to the rear of the queue.
- **Dequeue (Remove):** Removes an element from the front of the queue.
- **Peek Front:** Allows access to the front element without removing it.
- **Peek Rear:** Allows access to the rear element without removing it.

### **3. Applications of a Queue:**
Queues are widely used in various domains, primarily due to their **FIFO** nature. Some examples include:

- **Job Scheduling**: In operating systems, tasks/jobs are scheduled in a queue to ensure fair processing.
- **Printing Queues**: In a printing system, print jobs are managed in a queue, ensuring that the first document submitted gets printed first.
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: In graph traversal algorithms, BFS uses a queue to explore nodes level by level.
- **Customer Service**: In real-life applications, such as call centers or service centers, customers are served in a queue (first come, first served).
- **Network Buffers**: Packets in a network switch or router are stored in queues before being processed.

### **4. Circular Queue:**
the implementation is an example of a **circular queue**, where:
- **Front** and **Rear** pointers move circularly within a fixed-size array.
- The use of modulo arithmetic ensures that the queue wraps around when the rear or front reaches the end of the array.

### **5. Key Characteristics of a Queue:**
- **FIFO Access**: The first element inserted is the first element removed.
- **Limited Access**: Only the front element is accessible for removal, and only the rear element is accessible for insertion.
- **Fixed Size**: In your case, the queue has a fixed maximum size (`maxSize`), beyond which elements cannot be added without removing existing ones.

### **6. Important Operations in the Code:**

- **Insert (Enqueue)**:
  - `rear = (rear + 1) % maxSize;` ensures the rear wraps around the array when it reaches the end.
  - The element is added at the position of `rear`.
  - The number of elements is incremented.

- **Remove (Dequeue)**:
  - The element at the front is removed.
  - `front = (front + 1) % maxSize;` ensures the front wraps around when it reaches the end of the array.
  - The number of elements is decremented.

### **7. Circular Queue Advantages:**
- **Efficient Space Utilization**: Circular queues make full use of the arrayâ€™s space by reusing positions once elements are dequeued.
- **No Shifting Elements**: Unlike linear queues implemented with arrays, where shifting elements may be required after each dequeue, circular queues avoid this overhead.

### **Common Questions on Queues**:
1. **How does a queue work internally, and why is it different from a stack?**
   - A queue works based on FIFO, where elements are added at one end and removed from another, unlike a stack that uses LIFO (Last In, First Out).

2. **What happens when you try to enqueue into a full queue?**
   - In your implementation, it prints a message indicating the queue is full, but in some cases, you can implement dynamic resizing.

3. **What are the real-world applications of queues?**
   - Used in various fields such as scheduling tasks, buffering network packets, and in simulations of real-world processes like service systems.
